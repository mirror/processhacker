    <p><em><strong>Process Hacker</strong></em></p>

    <h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker is a tool to view and manipulate processes and services. It can display process' threads,
    modules, memory regions and handles, search through process memory, and read/write memory using 
    a built-in hex editor.</p>

    <h1 id="options">Options</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker's options are accessible from the <strong>Options</strong> menu item 
    in the <strong>Hacker</strong> menu.</p>
    
    <h2>General</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Update Interval</dt>
      <dd>The amount of time in milliseconds between each <em>update</em>; i.e, when 
      Process Hacker looks for new, modified or removed processes, services and other objects.</dd>
      
      <dt>Processes in icon menu</dt>
      <dd>The number of processes to display in the notification icon menu.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Engine</dt>
      <dd>This is used by the <strong>Search Online...</strong> menu item in the process and module 
      context menus. <code>%s</code> is replaced by the name of the selected process or module.</dd>
      
      <dt>Require Signatures</dt>
      <dd>If <strong>Verify signatures and perform additional checks</strong> is enabled, this 
      specifies the processes that must have a valid signature. Processes with a <em>name</em> 
      that is specified in this field and do not have a valid signature will be highlighted 
      as a <em>Packed/Dangerous Process</em> (see Higlighting options).</dd>
      
      <dt>Max. Size Unit</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the maximum unit of size; sizes which can be displayed as 1024 or less in a 
      smaller unit will be displayed in that smaller unit, while sizes requiring a larger unit will 
      use units up to the maximum unit specified here.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when minimized</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide itself when it is minimized. You 
      can double-click on the notification icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide when closed</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will automatically hide itself when it is closed. You 
      can double-click on the notification icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Start hidden</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will start hidden. You can double-click on the notification 
      icon to show Process Hacker.</dd>
      
      <dt>Allow only one instance</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will allow only one instance of itself. Any attempts to start 
      a new instance will show the existing instance.</dd>
      
      <dt>Float child windows</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, child windows such as process properties and the memory editor will float 
      above the main Process Hacker window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Scroll down the process tree at startup</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will scroll down the process tree to the first instance of 
      explorer.exe running as the current user at startup.</dd>
      
      <dt>Show user/group domains</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will show the domain of users and groups: <code>user</code> 
      would be shown as <code>machine-name\user</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Advanced</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Enable kernel-mode driver</dt>
      <dd>Some handles cannot be displayed by a user-mode program like Process Hacker; this 
      option enables <em>KProcessHacker</em> which allows Process Hacker 
      to display all handles and bypass rootkits/security software. If enabled, it will be 
      loaded the next time Process Hacker is started.</dd>
      
      <dt>Enable experimental features</dt>
      <dd>Enables experimental features such as process protection.</dd>
      
      <dt>Verify signatures and perform additional checks</dt>
      <dd>This option affects newly created processes, and controls whether Process Hacker will 
      attempt to verify the digital signatures of processes and detect packed images.</dd>
      
      <dt>Replace Task Manager with Process Hacker</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, any attempt to start Task Manager will start Process Hacker instead.</dd>
      
      <dt>Warn about potentially dangerous actions</dt>
      <dd>If disabled, Process Hacker will not show confirmation prompts for most actions.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide handles with no name</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, unnamed handles will be hidden by default. This can be changed in each 
      process properties window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Hide Process Hacker network connections</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, network connections made by Process Hacker will be hidden in the network 
      connections list.</dd>
      
      <dt>Elevation</dt>
      <dd>Controls how Process Hacker will prompt for elevation in operations where the user 
      does not have required permissions.</dd>
      
      <dt>Max. Sample History</dt>
      <dd>Specifies the maximum number of performance-related samples to be retained. This includes 
      CPU, I/O and memory usage data for the system and all processes.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Highlighting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Highlighting Duration</dt>
      <dd>This specifies the amount of time for which new and removed objects (processes, threads and services) 
      are highlighted in a different color.</dd>
      
      <dt>New Objects</dt>
      <dd>New processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions, and handles.</dd>
      
      <dt>Removed Objects</dt>
      <dd>Terminated/deleted processes, services, threads, modules, memory regions and 
      handles.</dd>

      <dd>Processes running under the SYSTEM user account.</dd>
      
      <dt>Service Processes</dt>
      <dd>Processes hosting one or more services.</dd>
      
      <dt>Debugged Processes</dt>
      <dd>Processes currently being debugged.</dd>
      
      <dt>Elevated Processes</dt>
      <dd>Processes running with full privileges on a computer with

      <dt>POSIX Processes</dt>
      <dd>POSIX subsystem processes (also known as Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications).</dd>
      
      <dt>Packed/Dangerous Processes</dt>
      <dd>Packed images and images with invalid signatures. These processes 
      are often, but not always malicious - normal executables are often packed to reduce their 
      size.</dd>
      
      <dt>Suspended Threads</dt>
      <dd>Threads which have been suspended.</dd>
      
      <dt>GUI Threads</dt>

      <dt>Inherit Handles</dt>
      <dd>Handles which will be inherited by child processes.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Plotting</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Use Anti-aliasing</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, Process Hacker will draw graphs with anti-aliasing. This will 
      usually consume much more system resources than normal.</dd>
      
      <dt>Step</dt>
      <dd>This option controls the distance in pixels between each data point.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Symbols</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Dbghelp.dll path</dt>
      <dd>Select the path to the most recent version of dbghelp.dll you have 
      installed on your computer. If you do not have the latest version, go to 
      <code>http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx</code> and 
      download Debugging Tools for Windows.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search path</dt>
      <dd>Type in a symbol server path. Most users will want to use the following: 
      <code>SRV*<strong>C:\Users\USERNAME\Symbols</strong>*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</code>. 
      This will have any needed symbols downloaded from Microsoft's symbol server to 
      the specified directory (in bold).</dd>
      
      <dt>Undecorate symbols</dt>
      <dd>If enabled, C++ symbol names will be undecorated (unmangled). This is most 
      useful for methods with complex signatures.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h1 id="numberinput">Number Input</h1>
    <p>Process Hacker supports the input of numbers in various bases (including some non-standard
    extensions). This is allowed in: Get Function Address, Change Memory Protection, the Go To
    box in Read/Write Memory, and the insertion of numbers through the <strong>Utilities</strong>
    button.</p>
    <p>A number is assumed to be in base 10 unless:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It starts with <code>0</code> (zero) - octal (base 8)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>0x</code> - hexadecimal (base 16)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>b</code> - binary (base 2)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>t</code> - ternary (base 3)</li>		
      <li>It starts with <code>q</code> - quaternary (base 4)</li>
      <li>It starts with <code>w</code> - base 12</li>				
      <li>It starts with <code>r</code> - base 32</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1 id="proctree">Process Tree</h1>
    <p>The process tree displays processes running on the system as a tree; processes started by a 
    particular parent process are shown indented below it. Processes with a non-existent parent 
    (where its parent has terminated) are shown on the far left. You can manipulate processes by 
    right-clicking on them, and you can show detailed properties for a process by double-clicking 
    it or selecting the "Properties..." menu item.</p>
    
    <p>You can sort by the various columns by clicking on them - the tree view will temporarily 
    become a flat list. You can click the same column again to sort in the reverse order, and 
    once more to return to the tree view.</p>
    
    <p>Like Process Explorer, Process Hacker shows Deferred Procedure Calls (DPCs) and Interrupts 
    in the process tree. The only information these "processes" show is their CPU usage.</p>
    
    <h2>Context Menu</h2>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Manipulating csrss.exe, dwm.exe, lsass.exe, lsm.exe, smss.exe,
    winlogon.exe or any other system processes is not recommended and may lead to system instability or
    a crash.</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Terminate Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the selected process(es). If KProcessHacker is enabled, Process Hacker 
      will, except under extraordinary circumstances, be able to terminate any process, 
      including ones protected by rootkits or security software.</dd>

      <dt>Terminate Process Tree</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the selected process and its descendants.</dd>

      <dt>Suspend Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Suspends the selected process(es). If KProcessHacker is enabled and running on 
      Windows Vista, Process Hacker will be able to suspend any process, including ones 
      protected by rootkits or security software.</dd>

      <dt>Resume Process(es)</dt>
      <dd>Resumes the selected process(es). If KProcessHacker is enabled and running on 
      Windows Vista, Process Hacker will be able to resume any process, including ones 
      protected by rootkits or security software.</dd>
      
      <dt>Restart</dt>
      <dd>Restarts the selected process with the same command line arguments and working 
      directory.</dd>
      
      <dt>Reduce Working Set</dt>
      <dd>Empties the selected process(es)' working set(s). 
      This is a safe function; the process will eventually reclaim most of its working set.</dd>
      
      <dt>Virtualization</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to enable or disable virtualization for the selected process, if allowed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Affinity...</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to view and modify the process' CPU affinity (the CPUs on which it is allowed 
      to run).</dd>
      
      <dt>Create Dump File...</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to create a crash dump file for the process. This operation does not actually 
      cause the process to crash or terminate.</dd>
      
      <dt>Terminator...</dt>
      <dd>A tool which tries to terminate the selected process using many different techniques.</dd>
      
      <dt>Detach from Debugger</dt>
      <dd>Detaches the process from any debugger. This will cause any attached debuggers to stop working.</dd>
      
      <dt>Heaps...</dt>
      <dd>Shows the heaps created by the process. Note that this action causes a temporary thread 
      to be created in the process and should be used with caution.</dd>
      
      <dt>Inject DLL...</dt>
      <dd>Allows you to select a DLL file (or any other PE image) that will be injected into 
      the selected process. This option is only available for processes running in the same 
      session as Process Hacker (usually processes in the same user account).</dd>

      <dt>Priority</dt>
      <dd>Sets the process's priority - Real Time, High, Above Normal, Normal, Below Normal, Idle.
      This option is not available when multiple processes are selected.</dd>
      
      <dt>Run As</dt>
      <dd>
      <strong>Launch As User...</strong> - This allows you to run the selected process as another user.<br />
      <strong>Launch As This User...</strong> - This allows you to run a program under the selected process' user. This 
      is useful when you want to start a program as another user but you do not have that user's password.</dd>
      
      <dt>Search Online...</dt>
      <dd>Opens the default web browser with the search engine specified in Process Hacker's options.</dd>
      
      <dt>Re-analyze</dt>

      <dt>Select All</dt>
      <dd>Selects all items in the list.</dd>
    </dl>
    
    <h2>Terminator tests</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>TP1</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the process using the NtTerminateProcess function.</dd>
      
      <dt>TP2</dt>
      <dd>Uses the RtlCreateUserThread function to create a thread in the process which calls 
      ExitProcess, terminating the process. On Vista and above, the thread calls 
      RtlExitUserProcess.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT1</dt>
      <dd>Terminates the process' threads by using the NtTerminateThread function.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT2</dt>
      <dd>Sets the contexts of the process' threads to point to the ExitProcess function. The 
      process will be terminated when one of the threads are context switched to.</dd>
      
      <dt>TP1a</dt>
      <dd>(Windows Server 2003 and above only.) Uses NtGetNextProcess to open a handle to the process and terminate it 
      using NtTerminateProcess.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT1a</dt>
      <dd>(Windows Server 2003 and above only.) Uses NtGetNextThread to open a handle to each of the process' threads and 
      terminates them using NtTerminateThread.</dd>
      
      <dt>CH1</dt>
      <dd>Uses NtDuplicateObject to close the process' handles. This method works best for 
      complex programs.</dd>
      
      <dt>TJ1</dt>
      <dd>Creates a job, assigns the process to it, and terminates the job, terminating the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>TD1</dt>
      <dd>Creates a debug object, assigns the process to it, and closes the debug object, 
      terminating the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>TP3</dt>
      <dd>Uses the internal kernel-mode function PsTerminateProcess to terminate the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT3</dt>
      <dd>Uses the internal kernel-mode function PspTerminateThreadByPointer to terminate the process' 
      threads.</dd>
      
      <dt>TT4</dt>
      <dd>Queues a kernel-mode special asynchronous procedure calls (APCs) to each of the process' threads. 
      This APC calls PspTerminateThreadByPointer to directly terminate the threads. This method will 
      terminate threads hanging due to kernel-mode code, but the system may crash or freeze because 
      kernel-mode code is not given the chance to release any resources. <strong>Use this option with 
      extreme caution.</strong></dd>
      
      <dt>M1</dt>
      <dd>Uses WriteProcessMemory to write random data to the process' memory, crashing the process.</dd>
      
      <dt>M2</dt>
      <dd>Uses VirtualProtectEx to prevent the process' pages from being used, crashing the process.</dd>

    <h1 id="results">Results Window</h1>
    <p>The Results Window is displayed when searching for data, scanning for strings or 
    scanning for heaps. There are five buttons at the top of the window:</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Refresh</dt>
      <dd>This performs the search again.</dd>
      
      <dt>Edit Search</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to edit the search type and data associated with the Results Window.</dd>
      
      <dt>Filter</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to filter the search results, creating a new Results Window containing 
      the matching items. To filter using a numerical relation, enter the relation (for example, 
      greater than or equal to <code>&gt;=</code>) followed by the number. If the filter 
      (<code>&gt;=10</code>) is applied to the <strong>Length</strong> column, all items with a 
      length greater than or equal 10 will be displayed.</dd>
      
      <dt>Intersect</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to select another Results Window. It then creates a third Results Window
      in which the search results present in both Results Windows are displayed. This allows you
      to filter search results.</dd>
      
      <dt>Save...</dt>
      <dd>This allows you to save the search results to a text file.</dd>

    <h1 id="glossary">Glossary</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Affinity</dt>
      <dd>The set of processors on which a thread or collection of threads (process) is allowed to 
      execute on.</dd>
      <dt>Child Process</dt>
      <dd>A new process started by an existing one.</dd>
      <dt>Command Line</dt>
      <dd>A <em>string</em> describing a program to start and any parameters to pass to it. Examples: 
      <code>C:\Windows\notepad.exe C:\Windows\win.ini</code>, <code>cmd /TF0</code></dd>
      <dt>Commit</dt>
      <dd>A committed page or memory region contains actual data. Compare with <em>reserve</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Context Switch</dt>
      <dd>The act of switching a processor to run another thread. Since processors can only run one task 
      at a time, context switching gives the illusion of multi-tasking.</dd>
      <dt>Data Execution Prevention</dt>
      <dd>The Windows implementation of NX (No eXecute) technology, designed to prevent the execution of data 
      regions as code. This can prevent certain types of software attacks.</dd>
      <dt>Elevation (UAC)</dt>
      <dd>Under UAC, a process which is elevated has full administrative rights to system resources.</dd>
      <dt>Environment Variable</dt>
      <dd>A variable accessible to processes describing the operating system environment. Environment variables 
      are normally inherited by <em>child processes</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Handle</dt>
      <dd>A reference to a shared operating object or resource, e.g. a handle to an event, file or process.</dd>
      <dt>Heap</dt>
      <dd>A process-managed structure from which memory can be allocated. Since <em>pages</em> can only be 
      allocated in large chunks, using a heap will reduce wastage of memory for small allocations.</dd>
      <dt>Image</dt>
      <dd>A "package" containing executable code.</dd>
      <dt>Interrupt</dt>
      <dd>An event, usually signaled by hardware, that is handled by the operating system through a 
      <em>interrupt handler</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Kernel</dt>
      <dd>A collection of code that manages system-wide resources such as I/O, processes and threads, and 
      security. System calls are also handled by the kernel.</dd>
      <dt>Kernel-mode</dt>
      <dd>A processor mode in which code can access hardware directly and access all memory. For example, when 
      a <em>system call</em> is made, the processor switches to kernel-mode in order to perform an action on 
      the requester's behalf. When the system call finishes, it switches back to user-mode and the requester 
      continues normal execution.</dd>
      <dt>Kernel-mode thread</dt>
      <dd>A thread that runs solely in kernel-mode. These are usually worker threads that carry out delayed 
      operating system tasks. Most kernel-mode threads are contained in the System process, but in some systems 
      csrss.exe also runs kernel-mode threads.</dd>
      <dt>LPC</dt>
      <dd>Local inter-Process Communication (or Local Procedure Call). A Windows NT mechanism which enables 
      processes to communicate with each other.</dd>
      <dt>LUID</dt>
      <dd>Locally Unique IDentifier. A value which is unique on the local system until it is rebooted.</dd>
      <dt>Module</dt>
      <dd>An executable image which can be loaded by processes. Through this mechanism, code and resources 
      may be shared.</dd>
      <dt>Page</dt>
      <dd>A block of memory, 4 kB in size on x86 and AMD64 processors.</dd>
      <dt>PEB</dt>
      <dd>Process Environment Block. The PEB contains a variety of data used by the process.</dd>
      <dt>Privilege</dt>
      <dd>A privilege belonging to a process. It can be enabled or disabled, and certain system calls require 
      the presence of specific privileges to work.</dd>
      <dt>Process</dt>
      <dd>A collection of <em>threads</em> along with virtual memory, <em>handles</em> and other resources.</dd>
      <dt>Protection (DRM)</dt>
      <dd>Process and thread protection introduced in Windows Vista, designed to enhance support for digital 
      restrictions management. Examples of processes protected by this mechanism include System and audiodg.exe.</dd>
      <dt>Reserve</dt>
      <dd>A reserved page or memory region does not contain data and has not been allocated storage in physical 
      memory. Reserving pages is commonly done to ensure a certain amount of contiguous address space is available 
      without actually allocating storage. Compare with <em>commit</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Service</dt>
      <dd>A operating system managed program which runs in the background. They can be in shared processes 
      (in svchost.exe instances), in separate processes, or drivers loaded into kernel-mode space.</dd>
      <dt>SID</dt>
      <dd>Security IDentifier. A unique identifier assigned to security-related objects such as users and groups.</dd>
      <dt>String</dt>
      <dd>A sequence of characters - text.</dd>
      <dt>System Call</dt>
      <dd>A request that is made by a thread to the <em>kernel</em> to perform a task on the thread's behalf. This done 
      because most threads run in user-mode and are unable to access hardware directly. See <em>kernel-mode</em>.</dd>
      <dt>System Thread</dt>
      <dd>See <em>kernel-mode thread</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Thread</dt>
      <dd>A unit of execution belonging to a process, running code concurrently. Most threads run in <em>user-mode</em>, 
      but some are <em>kernel-mode threads</em>.</dd>
      <dt>User Account Control</dt>
      <dd>Refers to restrictions on normal processes preventing them from modifying system-wide files and settings. 
      Processes which are <em>elevated</em> have full administrative access to system resources.</dd>
      <dt>Virtualization (UAC)</dt>
      <dd>A technology which redirects writes to the file system and registry for processes which are not 
      <em>elevated</em>.</dd>
      <dt>Working set</dt>
      <dd>The collection of <em>pages</em> recently referenced by a process. These pages are in physical 
      memory, while other pages may be in the pagefile.</dd>
      <dt>WOW64</dt>
      <dd>A technology which enables 32-bit programs to run on 64-bit Windows systems.</dd>
